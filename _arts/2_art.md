Eye of Flora integrates mixed reality (MR) technology, transforming the biosignal flows from the exhibitionâ€™s various works and external environmental elements into virtual particle systems that overlay the physical environment. In the interplay between the material world and the metaphysical universe, humans often act from an anthropocentric perspective, overlooking other species and marginalized entities. This results in virtual forests without real trees, and virtual beasts without real animals. This work is dedicated to preventing non-human species from vanishing in the digital migration.
