Immersive Flora is a hybrid system that allows users to engage with the remote natural environment by virtually showcasing diverse plant-environment interactions within a forest. In this immersive experience, plants act as sensors, detecting changes in natural elements and seamlessly transmitting this information to a virtual environment that faithfully replicates reality and dynamically responds to alterations. As illustrated in Figures above and subsequent, this system consists of three stages: 1- plant-environment signaling, 2- forest environment 3D reconstruction, and 3- plant-environment interaction visualization in VR.
