HoloFlora is an innovative MR application designed to deepen understanding of forest biodiversity. It allows users to highlight often-overlooked ecological indicators—such as mushrooms, tree cavities, and holes—directly within natural environments. Developed using the Unity Game Engine in combination with the Immersal Solution for Microsoft HoloLens 2, HoloFlora serves as a powerful tool for education and training in biodiversity recognition. HoloFlora's methodology enables seamless integration of holographic content into forests, making it versatile for applications beyond education, such as balancing economic and ecological data visualisation for decision-making in environmental management or resource planning.
